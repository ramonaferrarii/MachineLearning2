# Machine Learning 2 Project: Five Talking Robots.
This is a repository for Machine Learning course at Robotics Engineering Master Degree at University of Genoa. 

The dataset is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and it contains 10 numbers spoken by 5 robots. The project aims to provide classifiers for understanding which robot is talking by only knowing the numbers said. The robots are univocally identified by an ID number: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. For more information about the dataset, see the following link: [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msk1097/classification-of-robots-from-their-conversation). 

The classifiers here implemented are: 
* Linear SVC
* SVC with linear and rbf kernel
* Knn classifier
